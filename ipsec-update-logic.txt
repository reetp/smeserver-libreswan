Script logic

access = public/public

If disabled we should force access = private but this wouldn't get picked on service restart up as the templates are already expanded

Currently disabled

Here is a list of the rough logic in the ipsec-update script.

Stopped & Disabled

# expand-templates
If stopped & disabled
    set access private
    stop ipsec service
    reset redirects
# restart services

Stopped & Enabled

# expand-templates
If stopped & enabled
    set access public
    reset redirects
# restart services

Started

# expand-templates
set access public
If started and enabled
    reset redirects
    Check previous status
    Reread secrets
    If en-en
    auto replace
        If start
        auto --up
        changestate
    
    Elseif disabled-disabled
    stop
    changestate

    Elseif disabled-enabled
    auto --replace
        If start
        auto --up
        changestate

    Elseif enabled-disabled
    stop
    changestate


If not started and enabled
    reset redirects
    set access public
    start service

# restart services
