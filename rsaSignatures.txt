This is a tricky subject so please bear with me

First we need to start the NSS database. This only needs run once - if we delete the dbs then ipsec will recreate them on a restart

ipsec initnss

First we need to generate our keys as follows :

ipsec newhostkey --output /etc/ipsec.d/rsa.secrets

We need JUST the public key portion at each end.

We can use either of:

ipsec showhostkey --left
ipsec showhostkey --file /etc/ipsec.d/rsa.secrets --left

cat /etc/ipsec.d/rsa.secrets |grep pubkey |sed 's/.*key=//'


This is where it gets trickier if you use 'Local' / 'Remote' as names - better to stick to ServerA/ServerB or East/West

Remember that the only bit that we give out here is the PUBLIC part of the key on each server.


On East

To get a clean copy of the key

cat /etc/ipsec.d/rsa.secrets |grep pubkey |sed 's/.*key=//'

Be VERY CAREFUL when you copy and paste.



db ipsec_connections setprop East leftrsasig `cat rsa.secrets |grep pubkey |sed 's/.*key=//'`

That will set the left rsa key

That key then needs to go on West as rightrsasig (EAST public key)





db ipsec_connections setprop West leftrsasig `cat rsa.secrets |grep pubkey |sed 's/.*key=//'`

That key then needs to go on West as rightrsasig (EAST public key)


In short

East
leftrsasig=PUBLIC key of East
rightrsasig=PUBLIC key of West

West
leftrsasig=PUBLIC key of West
rightrsasig=PUBLIC key of East


Emergencies....

To delete all old dbs

rm /etc/ipsec.d/*.db
rm /etc/ipsec.d/pkcs11.txt

signal-event post-upgrade;signal-event reboot

ipsec will generate new dbs for you on restart
